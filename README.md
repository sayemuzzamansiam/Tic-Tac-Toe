A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in **C** and **HTML/CSS/JS**.


## ðŸš€ Features
- **C Version**: Terminal-based gameplay.
- **Web Version**: Interactive UI with confetti animations.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns to place their marks (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

### Game Setup:
- **Player 1**: Uses **"X"**.
- **Player 2**: Uses **"O"**.

### Instructions:

1. **Start the Game**:
   - For the **Web Version**, simply open the game in your browser. Player 1 (X) will make the first move.
   - For the **C Version**, launch the program from your terminal. The game will prompt you to choose your move each turn.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns marking an empty space on the grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O").
   - **Web Version**: Click on any empty space to place your mark.
   - **C Version**: You will be prompted to enter the row and column (1-3) to place your mark.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - In the **Web Version**, when a player wins, confetti animations will appear.
   - Both versions will display a message announcing the winner.

4. **Draw**:
   - If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.

5. **Restart the Game**:
   - **Web Version**: Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
   - **C Version**: Restart the program to begin a new game.

### Tips:
- Think ahead and try to block your opponent from completing a row of three marks.
- Try to create multiple winning opportunities at once to force your opponent into a defensive position!
